# Revised Design System Directive: EOS – "The Lucid Dawn"

**Aesthetic Codename:** Lucid Dawn / Mineral Warmth 

**Core Concept:** The precise moment the sun hits a stone wall. It is grounded (mineral) but active (light). It balances "Medical Clarity" with "Human Warmth."


### 1. Color System: "Atmospheric Sunrise"

**Philosophy:** A transition from darkness to clarity. Avoid "Tropical Sunrise" (bright orange/pink). Use "Nordic Sunrise" (muted clay, slate, pale gold).



* **Backgrounds (The Stable Base):**
    * **Mineral White:** `#F9F9F7` (Not clinical white, but stone-white).
    * **Warm Concrete:** `#E6E5E0` (Used for secondary backgrounds).
* **The "Dawn" Gradient (Brand Identity):**
    * *Definition:* A subtle gradient used for primary buttons or hero backgrounds.
    * *Stops:* **Deep Slate** (`#2F3A40`) $\to$ **Burnt Clay** (`#C57B57`) $\to$ **Muted Gold** (`#D6C6A6`).
* **Action Colors:**
    * *Primary Text/UI:* **Night Slate** (`#1F2933`). Never pure black.
    * *Interactive:* **Clay** (`#C57B57`). Used for links and active states.
    * *Highlight:* **Morning Light** (`#F0EAD6`). Used for "Spotlight" effects.


### 2. Texture & Surface: "Grain & Spotlight"



* **The "Realness" Filter (Grain):**
    * *Directive:* To avoid "hyper-polished gym aesthetics," apply a subtle SVG noise overlay to all solid color backgrounds.
    * *Opacity:* 3-5% noise on colored surfaces.
* **The "Spotlight" Card:**
    * *Concept:* The logo concept is "a platform that makes things visible."
    * *Style:* Cards are **White** on **Mineral Backgrounds**.
    * *Effect:* Instead of a drop shadow, use a subtle **Inner Glow** or a radial gradient background that creates a "halo" of light behind the active element.


### 3. Typography: "Clear Stance, No Shouting"



* **Typeface Pairing:** **Merriweather ** (Headings) + **Geist ** (Body).
* **Typesetting Rules:**
    * *Headings:* Sentence case only. No all-caps shouting (per "No motivational shouting" rule).
    * *Body:* High line-height (1.6 to 1.75). The text must "breathe" just like the physical rooms.
    * *Micro-copy:* Direct and factual. "Book Class" (not "Start Your Journey").


### 4. Imagery Style: "Silhouettes & Light Edges"



* **Subject Matter:**
    * **Silhouettes:** Bodies in motion against bright backgrounds. Anonymous but human.
    * **Light Edges:** Photography should feature backlighting that creates a "rim light" (The Dawn effect) around the subject.
    * **Documentary:** Sweaty, messy hair, real exertion. No "posed perfection."
* **Composition:**
    * High whitespace in photography. The subject should occupy the bottom or side, leaving "Headspace" (Sky/Wall) open.


### 5. Motion & Physics: "Stable Dynamics"



* **Concept:** The CI mentions "It is flexible without appearing unstable."
* **Transitions:**
    * *Hover:* Elements do not "jump." They glow or shift color slightly.
    * *Page Load:* Staggered fade-ins (upwards). Mimics the rising sun.
    * *Speed:* Moderate (300ms). Not snappy/tech, but smooth/flow.


### 6. "No-Go" Zones (Developer Constraints)



* **Forbidden Colors:** Neon Green, Hot Pink, Chakra Purple.
* **Forbidden Fonts:** Handwritten scripts, Brush fonts (The CI explicitly bans "Female influencer yoga clichés").
* **Forbidden UI Patterns:**
    * Pop-ups shouting "Last chance!" (Violates "No pressure to perform").
    * Infinite scroll (Violates "Clarity/Counterpoint to overstimulation"). Use clear pagination or "Load More."
